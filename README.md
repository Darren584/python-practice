## Project Overview
This repository contains a set of Python functions that solve simple programming tasks. I wrote all the code myself, focusing on learning, thinking through problems, and explaining my logic clearly with comments.

## Tasks Completed

### Sum of Elements in a List
- Created a list containing numbers.
- Initialized a `total` variable at 0.
- Used a loop to go through each number in the list and add it to the total.
- Printed the final total after the loop.

### Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- Defined a function to check if a number is even or odd.
- Used the modulus operator to test if a number divides evenly by 2.
- Returned "Even" if true, "Odd" otherwise.
- Called the function to test it with different numbers.

### Factorial Using a Loop
- Defined a function to compute the factorial of a number.
- Initialized a variable `result` starting at 1.
- Used a loop that multiplies the result by each number from 1 up to `n`.
- Returned and printed the final factorial result.

### Reversing a String
- Defined a function to reverse a string manually.
- Created an empty string to build the reversed version.
- Used a loop to go through each character and prepend it to the new string.
- Returned and printed the reversed string.

### Factorial Using Recursion
- Defined a recursive function to find the factorial.
- Set up a base case for when `n` is 0 or 1, returning 1.
- Used the general case (`n * factorial(n-1)`) to keep calling the function until it reaches the base case.

### Sum of Digits
- Defined a function to calculate the sum of the digits in a number.
- Initialized a `total` variable.
- Converted the number into a string so each digit could be looped through.
- Added each digit (after converting it back to an integer) to the total.
- Returned the final result and called the function to test it.
